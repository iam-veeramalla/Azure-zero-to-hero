# Vocabulary in Cloud Computing

## Virtualization

Virtualization is the process of creating a virtual version of something, such as an operating system, server, storage, or network resources.

## Virtual Machine

A Virtual Machine (VM) is a software-based emulation of a physical computer. It allows running multiple operating systems on a single physical machine.

## API (Application Programming Interface)

API is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. It defines how software components should interact.

## Regions

Regions in cloud computing refer to geographic locations where cloud providers have data centers. Each region contains multiple data centers.

## Availability Zones

Availability Zones are isolated locations within a region that have their own power, cooling, and networking. They are designed to provide high availability and fault tolerance.

## Scalability

Scalability is the ability of a system to handle an increasing amount of work or its potential to be enlarged to accommodate that growth.

## Elasticity

Elasticity in cloud computing refers to the ability to dynamically scale resources up or down based on demand.

## Agility

Agility is the capability of quickly and easily adapting to changes. In the context of cloud computing, it involves the rapid deployment of resources and applications.

## High Availability

High Availability (HA) ensures that a system or application is operational and accessible for a high percentage of time, typically 99.9% or higher.

## Fault Tolerance

Fault Tolerance is the ability of a system to continue operating without interruption in the presence of hardware or software failures.

## Disaster Recovery

Disaster Recovery involves the planning and processes for restoring and recovering data and systems after a natural or human-induced disaster.

## Load Balancing

Load Balancing is the distribution of network traffic or computing workload across multiple servers to ensure no single server is overwhelmed.
